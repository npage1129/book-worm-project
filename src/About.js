      <h1>Althea</h1>
      <p>Althea came up with the topic for our project. After years of working as a nanny, 
        it became apparent to her that parents' love a good book reccomendation. Everytime 
        she was asked, she'd send them to an app to look up books. So why not create a website 
        representing her years of knowledge.

      <h1>Nicole</h1>
      <p>Nicole thought the idea was brilliant! She immediately jumped on board ready to
        get started!

      <h1>Luis</h1>
     
      <p>Luis loves children! He has a few nephews and nieces that although they drive him crazy 
        he loves to read to them. He was thrilled with this project idea and was jumping for joy when 
        we told him the topic! He was so excited to share the final project with his nieces and nephews!
        I'm pretty sure he's going to buy every book off of the site!
